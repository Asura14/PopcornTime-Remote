# PopcornTime Remote
A simple keyboard mapped remote for [PopcornTime](https://popcorntime.sh).

Unfortunately in Portugal most of the shows are not available in the main streaming services, and some streaming services are not available here either. Therefore, for some specific shows, Popcorn Time is my go to app. 

I made this remote for myself but feel free to use it.
